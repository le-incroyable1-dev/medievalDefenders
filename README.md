# projectX : Medeival Defenders

We are working towards building a multiplayer 2D game based on stealth and survival using Photon Unity Networking and Unity3D. It will replicate many of the mechanics of the popular game "Among Us". The game will be based in a medeival landscape, where groups of villagers defend the village against an intruder who pretends to be one of the tribe.

It is an initiative by Microsoft Student Chapter, TIET Derabassi
